## Team 2323 BarIQ

Team 2323 is tasked with creating an Interactive Resource Portal for new and existing customers using BarIQ technologies. Specifically, we are looking to make an interactive layout builder that implements RFID technology into beer warehouses, an ROI calculator for beer warehouse mangers, and a multi-purpose Search Engine page for users of the IRP.

We are working with Daniel Knotts, CTO of BarIQ, LLC.
